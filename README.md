#Vino

##A Hybrid App for Android

This project contains everything you need to create a hybrid app. The folder "/app/src/main/assets" has all of the assets of a mobile Web app called Vino. You could delete those and replace them with your own Web app. Just make sure the single page app has the name "index.html". Build and deploy. Oh, and you will need new icon images and startup images. Just examine the icons and startup images in the project to see the sizes and resolutions you need.
